### Requirements

You'll need the following to help us test Sus Tracker:

- An Amazon account
- A Windows PC
- An Alexa device OR the Alexa app installed on your smartphone (associated with your Amazon account)
- Among Us for Windows (Steam version)
- [Sus Tracker for Windows](https://mega.nz/file/ddByVZxS#1q3y1wG6VMbxmG2vi_YppEupgTxOf1ATo8BTM0T_VJA)

We'll need the email address associated with your Alexa device to add you to the beta, which you can submit here:

<form action="https://formcarry.com/s/zrKXtHkXKJ" method="POST" accept-charset="UTF-8" >
    <label for="signup" title="email sign-up"></label>
    <input id="signup" type="email" name="_reply_to" required placeholder="Email address">
    <input type="hidden" name="_gotcha">
    <br><br>
    <button>SIGN UP FOR THE BETA</button>
</form>

### Instructions

1. You'll get an email from Amazon notifying you that have been invited to the Sus Tracker beta -- keep an eye out for it (check your spam or junk folder if you don't see it in your inbox) and click on the link to accept the beta invite.

2. Make sure you have all the requirements in place. Then install [Sus Tracker for Windows](https://mega.nz/file/ddByVZxS#1q3y1wG6VMbxmG2vi_YppEupgTxOf1ATo8BTM0T_VJA) on your Windows PC and run it -- you will be asked for a six-digit code.

3. With your Alexa device in listening distance, say "Alexa, open Sus Tracker." -- you will then hear a brief explanation and a six-digit code. Enter that six-digit code in the Sus Tracker Windows app -- if you missed it, you can get your code again by saying, "Alexa, open Sus Tracker and get my code."

4. Run Among Us and start or join a game.

5. As you become suspicious of a player, assign sus to them by saying "Alexa, add sus to {color of the player} with Sus Tracker." You can add sus to a player multiple times with the same command, and you can clear sus from a player by saying "Alexa, clear all sus from {color of the player} with Sus Tracker." You can clear sus from all players by saying "Alexa, clear sus with Sus Tracker."

6. When it's time to vote, you can get a sus summary by saying "Alexa, get sus with Sus Tracker." All sus resets at the end of the round automatically.

7. Have fun!

### All possible commands

Preface every command with "Alexa ..."

- "Get my code with Sus Tracker." -- provides your login code.
- "Get sus with Sus Tracker." -- provides a summary of sus.
- "Add sus to {color of the player} with Sus Tracker." -- self-explanatory. Example: "Add sus to cyan with Sus Tracker."
- "Clear all sus for {color of the player} with Sus Tracker." -- self-explanatory.
- "Clear all sus with Sus Tracker." -- clears sus for all players.
