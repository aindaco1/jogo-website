### What is this?

**Sus Tracker is the first real-time voice assistant for [Among Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/).** Right now, you can use it to help you keep track of "sus" (AKA suspicion) of other players.

&nbsp;
### Requirements

You'll need the following to help us test Sus Tracker:

- An Amazon account
- A Windows PC
- An Alexa device OR the Alexa app installed on your smartphone (associated with your Amazon account)
- Among Us for Windows ([Steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/))
- [Sus Tracker for Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/sus-tracker/9pk9lvfx1rt9)

&nbsp;
### Instructions

1. Make sure you have all the requirements in place. Then install [Sus Tracker for Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/sus-tracker/9pk9lvfx1rt9) on your Windows PC and run it -- you will be asked for a six-digit code.

2. With your Alexa device in listening distance, say "Alexa, open Sus Tracker." -- you will then hear a brief explanation and a six-digit code. Enter that six-digit code in the Sus Tracker Windows app -- if you missed it, you can get your code again by saying, "Alexa, get my code with Sus Tracker."

3. Run Among Us and start or join a game.

4. As you become suspicious of a player, assign sus to them by saying "Alexa, add sus to {color of the player} with Sus Tracker." You can add sus to a player multiple times with the same command, and you can clear sus from a player by saying "Alexa, clear sus from {color of the player} with Sus Tracker." You can clear sus from all players by saying "Alexa, clear all sus with Sus Tracker."

5. When it's time to vote, you can get a sus summary by saying "Alexa, get sus with Sus Tracker." All sus resets at the end of the round automatically.

6. Have fun!

### What does the Sus Tracker Windows app do?

The Windows app detects when you've completed a round in Among Us and resets your sus automatically.

&nbsp;
### Helpful tips

- **Speak slowly and clearly to Alexa** -- otherwise, you'll probably end up adding sauce to your shopping list :)
- **You must end every command to Alexa with "with Sus Tracker"** -- we're working on a better solution.
- The Sus Tracker Windows app must be running while you're playing Among Us to automatically reset your sus at the end of every round. Otherwise, you'll need to manually clear all sus by voice command.
- After you start the Sus Tracker app, feel free to minimize it.

&nbsp;
### All possible commands

Preface every command with "Alexa ..."

- **"Get my code with Sus Tracker."** -- provides your login code.
- **"Get sus with Sus Tracker."** -- provides a summary of sus.
- **"Add sus to {color of the player} with Sus Tracker."** -- self-explanatory. Example: "Add sus to cyan with Sus Tracker."
- **"Clear sus for {color of the player} with Sus Tracker."** -- self-explanatory.
- **"Clear all sus with Sus Tracker."** -- clears sus for all players.
